# blockSec (i came up with this name on the spot)
This is quite a mid exploit. If you don't like it, please help me improve it.

# Requires:
Any extension that can block web elements (examples include Ublock Origin and Adblock Plus)

# Steps:
1. Open the following tabs:
    - mail.google.com
    - chrome://settings/clearBrowserData?search=cache
    - chrome://diagnostics
2. Clear your all-time cache.
3. In the Diagnostics window, start a CPU test.
4. on the Chrome Settings tab, enter the url of the website you want to unblock. 3 blue dots should appear.
5. Open the Element blocker extension, and block **IN BETWEEN THE 3 DOTS AND THE TOP LEFT OF THE SCREEN**.
6. Spam about 64 Gmail tabs.
And that's it!
